# 🌸 Iris Classification - Your First ML Project

**Difficulty:** ⭐ Beginner  
**Time Required:** ~30 minutes  
**Domain:** Classification  
**Dataset:** Iris (Built-in)

## 🎯 Project Overview

Welcome to your first machine learning project! This project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify three species of iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. It's the perfect introduction to the machine learning workflow.

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- 📊 **Data Loading**: How to load and explore datasets
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding your data through visualizations
- 🔧 **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing data for machine learning
- 🤖 **Model Training**: Training multiple ML algorithms
- 📈 **Model Evaluation**: Comparing and selecting the best model
- 🎯 **Performance Metrics**: Understanding accuracy, precision, recall

└── requirements.txt  # Project dependencies
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Project
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains:
- **150 samples** of iris flowers
- **4 features**: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- **3 classes**: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
- **No missing values** (perfect for beginners!)

## 🔧 Models Used

1. **🌳 Random Forest** - Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
2. **🎯 Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Finds optimal decision boundaries
3. **👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Classifies based on nearest neighbors
4. **📈 Logistic Regression** - Linear model for classification

## 📈 Expected Results

You should expect to achieve:
- **90%+ accuracy** on all models
- **Perfect classification** of Setosa species
- **Some confusion** between Versicolor and Virginica

## 🎯 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Complete ML Pipeline
```python
# 1. Load data
data = load_iris()

# 2. Explore data
print(data.describe())

# 3. Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# 4. Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Evaluate model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
```

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Pairplots**: Show relationships between features
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Identify feature correlations
- **Box Plots**: Compare feature distributions by species

### 3. Model Comparison
- **Cross-validation**: Robust performance estimation
- **Multiple metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall
- **Confusion matrices**: Detailed error analysis

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: No module named 'sklearn'**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

**Matplotlib plots not showing**
```bash
# Add this to your code
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or 'Qt5Agg'
```

**Seaborn style warnings**
```python
# Use updated seaborn syntax
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')
```
